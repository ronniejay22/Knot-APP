//  Captures a screenshot of the screen affected by a change so the autonomous
//  workflow can attach it to the PR (see Knot/CLAUDE.md and
//  iOS/scripts/capture-ui-screenshot.sh). The attachment MUST be named
//  "PR Screenshot" — the capture script looks it up by that name.
//
//  When a change touches a specific screen, edit the navigation slot below to
//  drive the app there before the screenshot is taken. With no edits this
//  captures the app's first screen, which is still a valid image.
